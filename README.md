# Natural Gas Storage Contract 

# Objective
As a quantitative researcher visualize the data to find patterns and consider what factors might cause the price of natural gas to vary. This can include looking at months of the year for seasonal trends that affect the prices, but market holidays, weekends, and bank holidays need not be accounted for. Each point in the data set corresponds to the purchase price of natural gas at the end of a month, from 31st October 2020 to 30th September 2024.
Analyze the data to estimate the purchase price of gas at any date in the past and extrapolate it for one year into the future. 
Your code should take a date as input and return a price estimate.
